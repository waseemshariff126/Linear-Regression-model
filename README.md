# Linear-Regression-model
Linear regression seeks to model the relationship between two variables by adapting a linear equation to the observed data. One variable is known as an explanatory variable and the other as a dependent variable. Of example, using a linear regression system, a model may want to link the salary of individuals to their years of experience.

### The dataset has been taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/karthickveerakumar/salary-data-simple-linear-regression/download)
